<h3>Get Card</h3>
You can buy weekly or multiple trip Tap and Ride cards.<br>

The full fare card is green and the concession card is orange. Both are rechargeable.<br>

You can't use your travel card to pay another person's fare at the same time as your own. Each person travelling will need to purchase their own card.<br>
